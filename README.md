Documentation https://github.com/sgwood63/VisualizeSamples/wiki/VisualizeCascadingTree

JSFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sgwood/7u1bo8e8/

In sample code: tree.html, treeDashboard.html

In source: js/VisualizeCascadingTree.js

VisualizeCascadingTree presents a hierarchical tree of values, based on the popular Fancytree JavaScript control https://github.com/mar10/fancytree and visualize.js. Fancytree samples are here: http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/index.html

It is a reusable component to use in your own web application. There are many extension points you can use to customize the look and feel and interactivity to meet your requirements.

**VisualizeFolderTree**

Documentation https://github.com/sgwood63/VisualizeSamples/wiki/VisualizeFolderTree

VisualizeFolderTree presents the JasperReports Server repository as a hierarchical tree in your web user interface, also based on Fancytree and also reusable.

**Overview of Cascading Input Controls and Visualize.js**

https://github.com/sgwood63/VisualizeSamples/wiki/Cascading-Input-Controls-and-Visualize.js 

In sample code: simpleCascading.html

JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sgwood/j4ct9d70/

When the JasperReports Server displays cascading input controls, it shows drop down lists for single selects, and a multi-select widget for multiple selects. As cascading values are selected in the UI, the related input controls are refreshed and displayed for selection.

This page gives an overview of how cascading input controls work with Visualize.

**Installing the Samples**

You need a commercial JasperReports Server running at http://localhost:8080/jasperserver-pro with visualize.js available.

The base samples that come with the JasperReports Server - reports, users - need to be deployed. These are installed in normal Jaspersoft evaluation instances.

Import the 2 exports in "<this Git repository>/JasperReportsServer Resources" into the JasperReports Server instance. 

Deploy the content of this Git repository to a web server.
